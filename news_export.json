        "source": "Economic Times",
        "country": "India",
        "summary": "Mumbai: Robust demand for office spaces has pushed commercial property leasing in the first three quarters of 2019 by 30% from a year ago, taking it closer to entire 2018’s performance and making sure that this year surpasses the peak touched last year.Driven by tech corporates — accounting for about a third of the leasing activity — office space take-up touched 47 million sq ft in the first nine months against entire 2018’s performance of 48.9 million sq ft, showed data from CBRE South Asia. With this, office leasing activity is now expected to touch its highest level ever, estimated to be over 60 million sq ft in 2019.Leasing activity stood at about 15.4 million sq ft during the quarter ended September, rising by nearly 23% on an annual basis. This was dominated by small- to medium-sized transactions. Small-sized transactions of less than 10,000 sq ft accounted for over 40% of the transaction activity in the quarter.\n  \n  \n  \n  71641558\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“With office leasing scaling a historic high in 2019, we expect further strengthening of occupier sentiment in the medium to long term, backed by corporates looking to expand or consolidate their operations. Favourable government initiatives, transparency in the real estate sector and the right reforms will improve investor sentiment greatly in the coming quarters,” said Anshuman Magazine, CEO, India, South-east Asia, Middle East and Africa, CBRE.Like last year, he expects occupiers would put in greater efforts to incorporate flexibility in their portfolios due to changes in the business environment. Occupiers continued to futureproof their portfolios and hedge against future rental escalations by pre-leasing space across various cities.Bengaluru, followed by Hyderabad, dominated large-sized deal closures, while a few large deals were also reported in the NCR and Pune as well. Large-scale deal closures were mostly dominated by tech firms and flexible space operators. Firms belonging to sectors such as research, consulting &amp; analytics, banking, financial services &amp; insurance (BFSI), and engineering &amp; manufacturing also closed large-sized deals.Tech corporates led the office space take-up, followed by research, consulting &amp; analytics companies (19%) and flexible space operators (15%). The rise in the share of flexible space operators (10% in the second quarter of 2019) was primarily a result of their continued expansion across almost all cities.“The share of the tech sector rose from 31% to 40% annually during 2019 year-to-date, which implies that a rise in technology alternatives, insourcing / job preservation in the US and a global slowdown have not had any specific impact on India’s position as a preferred outsourcing destination for both high-skilled and low-skilled tech services, research and development,” said Ram Chandnani, managing director, advisory &amp; transaction services, India, CBRE South Asia.Supply addition rose by more than 80% in 2019 YTD on an annual basis, with about 43.5 million sq. ft. of development completions reported.Four cities — Hyderabad, Bengaluru, NCR and Mumbai — accounted for almost 80% of this supply addition.Compared to the first three quarters in 2018, the share of SEZs in supply dipped from 40% to 27% during 2019 YTD. Supply addition in the quarter also rose by about 6% on a quarterly basis, touching about 15 million sq. ft. More than 70% of this supply was driven by Hyderabad and NCR, followed by Bengaluru.",

        "summary": "MUMBAI: Liquidity risk is increasing for Indian-based real-estate developers, as non-bank financial institutions (NBFI; including housing finance companies) are shying away from lending to the sector, said Fitch Ratings.Developers that rely on refinancing from NBFIs, particularly those with weak financial profiles, will be affected the most should conditions persist. The availability of unencumbered assets among large developers may be of limited use, as NBFIs are looking to shed their already-high exposure to the sector, especially to large borrowers.NBFIs have disproportionately increased their share of real-estate sector credit in the previous few years, owing to heightened risk aversion by banks; banks have been cutting exposure due to their own funding challenges that began in late 2018, which have become more acute in the previous few months; domestic bank exposures fell to 2.3% of loans in the financial year ending March 2019 from 2.8% in 2015-16.NBFIs are now also shying away from refinancing maturing debt of even large, proven developers to limit concentration risk to the sector. This is pushing developers towards alternative funding channels, such as private equity. The availability of such funding could be more limited than the value of maturing debt and may only be available to established developers with sufficient unpledged assets. It would also come at a higher cost. We believe banks may still consider exposure to quality real estate, but overall exposure continues to decline.Developers that are focused on high-end projects may face higher risk, as sales of such projects have slowed in the last two years. We believe these developers would be wary of taking sharp price corrections on unsold inventory to boost sales, except in extreme circumstances, as this could diminish the value of unsold inventory and weaken collateral cover for existing lenders.In addition, any boost in sales would be temporary. Meanwhile, developers with substantial exposure to affordable housing may still benefit from marginal access to lenders in light of healthy pre-sales growth, supported by India's substantial housing deficit and government incentives for buyers via the credit-linked subsidy scheme as well as for developers, including tax deductions and grant of infrastructure status, which entitles companies to some benefits and concessions.The government has announced measures to improve NBFI-sector liquidity, but their efficacy remains to be seen. For example, we believe the government's July 2019 announcement to provide a first-loss guarantee of 10% on securitised assets issued by NBFIs to banks could ease funding pressure for NBFIs in the short term. However, the provision refers only to financially sound issuers and there is a lack of clarity about the duration of the guarantee and the definition of what comprises a 'financially sound' entity. In addition, most of the actions by the authorities to alleviate the liquidity squeeze will benefit the largest and least risky NBFIs and is unlikely to address the pressure on the more property focused players.Defaults by two NBFIs - Infrastructure Leasing &amp; Financial Services Ltd (IL&amp;FS) in September 2018 and Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) in June 2019 - have contributed to the sector-wide liquidity squeeze, as investors have become more risk averse. Banks' low appetite for lending to real-estate developers is evidenced by the usually high risk weights attached to such loans. These are due to developers' typically low credit ratings amid high leverage, making exposure to the sector an inefficient use of banks' already-limited capital.Substantial bank recapitalisation to increase lending capacity could benefit NBFIs as well as real-estate developers, subject to the banks' risk appetite. Although a structural improvement in NBFI asset books would take time. Nonetheless, even under better conditions we expect NBFI's to tighten credit standards, with developers facing funding pressure until there is a broader improvement in their operations, with better end-user demand and pricing support.",

        "summary": "Adani Green Energy is set to seek board approval to raise Rs 6,150 crore ($750 million) to Rs 8,200 crore ($1 billion) through the qualified institutional placement (QIP) route, said people aware of the matter.Two group companies had got approval of their boards for fundraising on May 13 —Adani Enterprises (Rs 12,500 crore) and Adani Transmission (Rs 8,500 crore).The exercise is part of a group plan outlined internally last year to build a “three-year equity cushion” to support expansion plans.Adani Green has secured such capital-raising permission every year from its board except in 2021, as per a Bloomberg analysis.The capital raised by Adani Green Energy will be used to repay an outstanding $750 million, three-year bond issued in 2021 that’s due next year. The money is likely to be kept in a dedicated redemption reserve account and paid on the due date, said the people cited above.Renegotiating Terms With TotalThe original plan had been to prepay the bond after special Reserve Bank of India (RBI) approval but the company decided against this move.“We do not comment on routine business matters. All public disclosures on business matters are disclosed when appropriate,” an Adani Group spokesperson told ET.Adani Green is also renegotiating the terms of its agreement with French utilities giant TotalEnergies for a proposed $4 billion investment in a green hydrogen venture, having signed a memorandum of understanding in 2022. In February, Total said it was pausing the plan in the wake of the Hindenburg Research report on the Adani Group alleging stock manipulation and fraud. The Adani Group has rejected the report’s findings.Total had said it won’t immediately proceed with the plan that involved taking a 25% stake in Adani New Industries Ltd (ANIL), a subsidiary of Adani Enterprises.In June last year, ANIL and TotalEnergies had outlined a capex plan of $50 billion to set up a 2.5 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) of green hydrogen manufacturing capacity over the next 10 years, with the first phase of 1 mmtpa expected to be commissioned before 2030. Total had also made a total $10 billion capital commitment to the hydrogen venture, standing guarantor to 50% of the project’s debt, translating to $6 billion, ET had reported February 13.ANIL plans to manufacture green hydrogen and downstream products such as ammonia, urea, methanol and ethanol at its Khavda and Mundra SEZ facilities. The Khavda site has a land bank of 71,000 acres, which has a large-scale renewable deployment potential of 20 GW due to its high wind and solar resource potential.After the initial MoU, a more detailed ‘heads of agreement’ — pre-contractual negotiations for a commercial framework — was originally planned to be signed between May and September this year. But this is unlikely at this juncture.The Adani Group has, however, continued with the project work in Mundra on its own, aiming to complete a substantial part of the first phase of the integrated manufacturing ecosystem for ANIL by December.This involves 4.5 GW of solar module manufacturing capacity and 1.5 GW of wind turbine manufacturing capacity along with electrolysers, glass, aluminium frames etc. Analysts say over 5% of the total capex has already been incurred by Adani though the bulk of the work is scheduled for 2026-2028. Any binding agreement with Total is now expected only in 2024 or 2025 and the valuation and the overall commercial terms is likely to get altered as the French company is not incurring any of the greenfield project risks, they said.“We have 40 GW of land equivalent. We've been doing solar modules for the past five years. We know we will produce modules at 15 cents to 17 cents,” Robbie Singh, chief financial officer of Adani Enterprises, had told ET on January 22.Other than the green hydrogen project, Total has just over $3 billion of investments with Adani, including in gas distribution and solar projects, which it has played down as a small 2.4% slice of its total capital commitments.",

        "summary": "Lenders to Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Capital are likely to recover just about ₹10,000 crore after the winning bidder, Hinduja Group, declined to significantly improve its offer in the last round of bilateral negotiations that ended on Monday evening, people aware of the development told ET. The recovery, totalling about ₹10,090 crore on factoring in the target company's cash balances and the Hinduja offer, falls short of the ₹12,500-13,000 crore estimated liquidation value. A Hinduja Group entity, IndusInd International Holdings, offered ₹9,650 crore in the extended auction held on April 26. Hinduja improved the offer by only ₹10 crore during the bilateral negotiations, the people cited above said. In addition, the distressed financial services company has around Rs 430 crore as cash balances, which would be distributed among the lenders. This would add up to Rs 10,090 crore, equating to a 43% recovery for verified lenders.Administrator Nageswara Rao Y has admitted Rs 23,666 crore in claims from verified creditors.\"Hinduja Group will submit a detailed resolution plan by next week while lenders are in the process of finalising distribution of the proceeds,\" one of the persons cited above said. After this, the administrator will invite lenders to vote on the eligible plans.However, resolution of Reliance Capital will be subject to approval from the Supreme Court, which is scheduled to hear in August the auction-related dispute between Torrent Investments, a bidder also in the fray in the earlier rounds.  100459497Crucial LIC, EPFO RolesThe stand by LIC, the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) and JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction Co on approving the plan will be critical since they are majority debtholders. Yes Bank, an original Reliance Capital lender, sold its debt to JC Flowers ARC. A resolution plan can be approved only if 66% of creditors vote in its favour.Separately, Credit Suisse-led bondholders have decided not to contest a decision by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which directed them to return the custody of Reliance General Insurance shares to the administrator, said the people cited above.This has come as a major relief to the lenders that were worried the resolution might be delayed if Credit Suisse-led bondholders appealed against the tribunal's order.In 2018, Credit Suisse-led investors invested in bonds issued by Reliance Home Finance, a Reliance Capital unit. The home finance company failed to honour the payment on the due date.",

This is a surge of nearly Rs 350 from its closing price on Tuesday.Meanwhile, silver July futures contracts recovered from their day’s low on Tuesday and also opened higher by Rs 566 or 0.58% at Rs 98,041/kg.On Tuesday, gold and silver settled on a weaker note in the domestic and international markets. Gold June futures contract settled at Rs 95,143 per 10 grams with a loss of 0.83% and silver July futures contract settled at Rs 97,475 per kilogram with a loss of 0.54%. Gold and silver showed heavy selling pressure in the international markets amid a rebound in the dollar index after the postponement of the trade tariffs by the U.S. President of the European Union. The dollar index recovered from 1-month lows and the U.S. equity markets also gained, easing some safe-haven buying for precious metals.Today, the US Dollar Index, DXY, was hovering near the 99.80 mark, gaining 0.28 or 0.28%.The U.S. durable goods orders data and consumer confidence data released on Tuesday were also better than expected and pushed bullion prices lower. However, the U.S. trade tariff uncertainty and geopolitical tensions could support prices of precious metals at lower levels.“We expect gold and silver prices to remain volatile this week amid volatility in the dollar index, geopolitical tensions and ahead of the FOMC meeting minutes; gold prices could hold its support level of $3,200 per troy ounce and silver prices could also hold $31.80 per troy ounce levels on a weekly closing basis,” said Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvifinmart Commodity Research.How to trade gold?Manoj Kumar Jain suggested the following ranges for gold and silver on MCX:Gold has support at Rs 94,800-94,400 and resistance at Rs 95,500-96,000Silver has support at Rs 96,650-96,000 and resistance at Rs 98,250-99,100Jain suggests buying gold and silver until they hold their key support level of Rs 94,400 and Rs 96,650, respectively, on a closing basis. He further noted that gold could retest Rs 96,000 and silver could also retest Rs 98,250-99,000 levels in the upcoming sessions.Gold prices are witnessing volatility due to a lack of triggers. Profit booking is typically witnessed from higher levels on account of easing geopolitical tensions between Israel and Hamas and ongoing tariff relief measures, reducing safe-haven demand.“In the international market, Comex gold is expected to trade in a lower range of $3,250 to $3,325, while the domestic outlook now shifts to Rs 93,000–Rs 96,000,” noted Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency at LKP Securities.Deveya Gaglani, Senior Research Analyst - Commodities at Axis Securities, echoed a similar sentiment, stating, “Looking ahead, volatility is expected to remain elevated this week, with key macro triggers including the release of FOMC meeting minutes and prelim U.S. GDP data”.Gold rates in physical marketsGold Price today in DelhiStandard gold (22 carat) prices in Delhi stand at Rs 58,144/8 grams while pure gold (24 carat) prices stand at Rs 62,024/8 grams.Gold Price today in MumbaiStandard gold (22 carat) prices in Mumbai stand at Rs 57,624/8 grams while pure gold (24 carat) prices stand at Rs 61,464/8 grams.Gold Price today in ChennaiStandard gold (22 carat) prices in Chennai stand at Rs 56,928/8 grams while pure gold (24 carat) prices stand at Rs 60,728/8 grams.Gold Price today in HyderabadStandard gold (22 carat) prices in Hyderabad stand at Rs 56,840/8 grams while pure gold (24 carat) prices stand at Rs 60,568/8 grams.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "summary": "Anticipating a potential cyclical recovery in Aarti Industries, global brokerage firm UBS has issued a double upgrade on the stock, raising its rating from ‘sell’ to ‘buy’ and setting a target price of Rs 625. Following the upgrade, shares of Aarti Industries jumped 3.4% to hit an intraday high of Rs 494 on the BSE.The stock’s target price denotes an upside of 30.8% from its previous closing price on the BSE.The brokerage firm noted that their ‘seel’ rating was set against the backdrop of a peaking chemical cycle and risk to guidance/consensus expectations for the energy segment (n-methyl aniline, MMA). However, these factors have largely played out, with a likely bottoming of chemical cycles and a reset of MMA volume growth expectations after a sharp correction in gasoline-naphtha spreads.“The stock is down c35% from the Aug 2024 peak. We now expect meaningful improvement in company performance aided by the new CEO's strategic initiatives to optimise costs and new growth drivers,” UBS said in its report.Analysts at UBS expect a gradual improvement in the business cycle for Aarti Industries, supported by low channel inventory levels. They also anticipate a steady pickup in MMA volumes, which has been evident over the past two quarters despite rangebound spreads.Further, the company's continued focus on market development is seen as a key factor in sustaining MMA volumes amid ongoing volatility. Additionally, strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing operational efficiency are expected to support long-term growth.“We do not believe the market is fully pricing in these factors as the stock is trading below its five-year average EV/EBITDA,” UBS added.Also read: ITC tumbles 4% on BAT’s likely 2.6% stake sale worth Rs 15,000 croreThe company guidance is for EBITDA to increase Rs 8-12 billion by FY28, supported by cost optimisation (Rs 1.5-2 billion), volume and margin ramp-up (Rs 3.5-5.5 billion), and capex-led growth (Rs 3-4.5 billion).The global brokerage firm believes that this range is achievable, considering initial green shoots across chemistries; however, new capex contribution could be lower.“We expect an EBITDA increase of about Rs 10bn in FY25-28, factoring in: 1) higher end of guidance for fixed cost optimisation and improving capacity utilisation; 2) steady rise in realisation from FY27; and 3) only nominal contribution from new capacity in FY28,” UBS analysts noted.Further to this, an improvement in MMA volume is expected along with a focus on market creation from geographical diversification, customised shipments, and better pricing.The gasolinenaphtha spread has been healthy (average $13/barrel) during Q1FY26TD, despite a sharp correction in the crude oil price, and close to the long-term average before Q4 FY22.While cognizant of volatile spreads, UBS expects strategic initiatives to cushion volume/profitability volatility.

        "summary": "Apple Inc. lost an early round in a discrimination lawsuit brought in the U.S. by a female engineer from India who says her two managers -- one from her country, the other from Pakistan -- treated her as they would in their own countries: as a subservient.The woman’s case in California state court is the latest to allege workplace bias in Silicon Valley that focuses on cultural prejudices of some tech workers from South Asia. Cisco Systems Inc. is fighting a suit brought by California’s civil rights agency alleging bias against a member of India’s so-called lower castes, known as Dalits.Anita Nariani Schulze is part of the Sindhi minority -- she is Hindu, with ancestry in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan. Her complaint alleges that her senior and direct managers, both male, consistently excluded her from meetings while inviting her male counterparts, criticized her, micromanaged her work, and deprived her of bonuses, despite positive performance evaluations and significant team contributions.Schulze claims the managers’ animus reflects sexism, racism, religious bias and discrimination on the basis of national origin. The Sindhi Hindu nationality is “known for its technical acumen” and its gender equality, she says, which “exacerbated the managers’ discriminatory treatment.”In a tentative ruling on Wednesday, Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Sunil R. Kulkarni rejected Apple’s request to toss out the suit. While not ruling on the merits of the case, Kulkarni said Schulze had adequately supported her legal claims. Apple had argued her claims weren’t specific enough and were based on stereotypes.But the judge rejected Schulze’s request to represent a class of female Apple employees who suffered job discrimination over the last four years. He agreed with Apple that she didn’t show a pattern of discrimination that could be applied to a broader group.It wasn’t clear from the court’s docket whether the judge will hold a hearing Thursday before issuing a final ruling.Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.In the Cisco case, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleged that two Indian employees at the San Jose-based company discriminated against a Dalit co-worker on the basis of caste.Cisco has denied the claims, insisting it has “zero tolerance for discrimination.” It also said the lawsuit should be tossed out because caste isn’t a protected category under U.S. civil rights law.",
